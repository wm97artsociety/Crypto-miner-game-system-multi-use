Core Features

Cross-Platform Mining App
Runs on PCs, phones, tablets, Linux handhelds, and modded consoles. Uses native mining binaries compiled for each platform.

SHA-256 CPU Mining Engine Integration
Incorporates cpuminer/cgminer to mine Bitcoin or testnet via pooled mining.

Upgradeable Game Mechanics
Players can invest earned XP and in-game currency to upgrade virtual mining rigs, increasing hash rate and mining efficiency.

Real & Simulated Mining Modes
On low-power devices, simulated mining mimics rewards and progression; on capable devices, real mining generates actual BTC rewards (slowly).

Wallet Integration
Displays Bitcoin and Lightning wallet addresses, supports QR code scanning for payouts and donations.

Python Wrapper API
Connects UI to mining backend, controls start/stop, and fetches mining stats in real-time.

Tweaking Game Parameters and Hardware Power Impact on Rewards

Mining rewards in Bitcoin are a function of hash rate, network difficulty, power consumption, and time spent mining. The game system models these by letting you upgrade your rigs and supply chain inside the game, which affects:

Parameter	Game Effect	Real-World Analog

Hash Rate (MH/s)	Determines mining speed	Actual hashing power of hardware
Power Supply (Watts)	Impacts mining cost & speed	Electricity cost and hardware stability
Rig Upgrades	Increase hash rate, reduce power consumption	Better ASICs or overclocking
Pool Fees & Latency	Impacts net payout	Mining pool overhead and network delays
Mining Time	Total mining duration	Real-world mining uptime

Reward Modeling for Mining Up to 10 Bitcoin

Hash Rate (TH/s)	Power Consumption (kW)	Approx. Daily BTC Earned*	Time to 10 BTC (days)	Notes

0.01 (10 GH/s)	50	~0.00000001 BTC	1,000,000+	Typical smartphone mining; symbolic
1 (1,000 GH/s)	1,200	~0.0005 BTC	~20,000	Small ASIC farm level
10 (10,000 GH/s)	12,000	~0.005 BTC	~2,000	Mid-tier professional mining rig
100 (100,000 GH/s)	120,000	~0.05 BTC	~200	Large mining operation
1,000 (1 PH/s)	1,200,000	~0.5 BTC	~20	Large industrial-scale farm


*These are very rough estimates based on average network difficulty and BTC price (~$30k). Actual rewards vary widely.

How the Game Uses This Model

Your in-game hash rate directly translates to mining speed.

Power supply upgrades reduce electricity cost in game, allowing longer mining times.

Upgrading rigs increases hash rate exponentially but consumes more power.

You can set your target BTC reward in the game ‚Äî up to 10 BTC ‚Äî by adjusting rig upgrades and mining duration.

The system dynamically calculates expected BTC earned based on your chosen power, time, and hash rate.

Daily Bitcoin Mining Rewards & Power Costs Model

Key Variables in the Game System

Variable	Description	Units

Hash Rate (H)	Mining power of your rigs	TH/s (Terahashes per second)
Power Usage (P)	Electricity consumption of your rigs	kW (kilowatts)
Mining Time (T)	Daily mining time (typically 24 hours)	Hours (h)
BTC Price (B)	Current Bitcoin market price	USD / BTC
Electricity Cost (E)	Cost of electricity per kWh	USD / kWh

Step 1: Daily Bitcoin Earned (BTC/day)

Using average network difficulty and payout data, the rough formula is:

\text{BTC per day} = \frac{H \times 10^{12} \times 86400}{D \times 2^{32}} \times R

Where:

 = Hash rate in TH/s (converted to H/s inside the formula)

 = Current network difficulty (approx.  as of July 2025)

 = Block reward (6.25 BTC, currently, but halving applies)

86400 = seconds per day




Simplified estimate with today‚Äôs difficulty:

BTC_{day} \approx 0.0000055 \times H

Meaning:

1 TH/s = ~0.0000055 BTC per day

100 TH/s = ~0.00055 BTC per day

1000 TH/s = ~0.0055 BTC per day



---

Step 2: Power Consumption per Day (kWh)

\text{Power (kWh/day)} = P \times T

Where:

 = Power usage in kilowatts

 = Hours mining per day (usually 24)



---

Step 3: Power Cost per Day (USD/day)

\text{Cost} = \text{Power (kWh/day)} \times E

Where:

 = Cost per kWh in USD (e.g., $0.12/kWh typical in US)



---

Example Table: Daily BTC & Power Costs

Hash Rate (TH/s)	Power Use (kW)	BTC Earned per Day	Power kWh/Day	Power Cost (USD/day) at $0.12/kWh

0.01	0.05	0.000000055	1.2	$0.144
1	1.2	0.0000055	28.8	$3.46
10	12	0.000055	288	$34.56
100	120	0.00055	2880	$345.60
1000	1200	0.0055	28800	$3456.00

How the Game Uses This Model:

Player upgrades rigs: Increase hash rate , which increases daily BTC rewards.

Power supply upgrades: Optimize , reduce power usage per TH/s.

Cost vs reward balancing: Player manages electricity cost (game currency) vs BTC payout.

Mining time: Players can choose to mine less than 24h to save power.

Goal: Reach cumulative BTC targets (up to 10 BTC in-game).



---

Interactive Calculation Example (Pseudo-code for game logic):

def calculate_daily_rewards(hash_rate_ths, power_kw, electricity_cost_per_kwh=0.12, mining_hours=24):
    btc_per_day = 0.0000055 * hash_rate_ths
    power_consumed = power_kw * mining_hours
    power_cost = power_consumed * electricity_cost_per_kwh
    net_profit_btc = btc_per_day - (power_cost / current_btc_price)
    return btc_per_day, power_cost, net_profit_btc
